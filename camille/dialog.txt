Hey, I heard about your new friend... I know you like him, but something doesn't feel right about him, you know? He can't possibly be as perfect as he seems... He's gotta be lying about something. I bet he's hiding some sort of dark secret from you.
At least you won't have to meet him in person... What if he notices how awkward you are, or how plain you look? Oh... I get butterflies just thinking about it...
Welcome to the world of your thoughts, I suppose. ...Oh, you want to know why it's so dark and dreary here? Well, what were you expecting? Sunshine and rainbows? Ha... You don't deserve to be happy, not even in this dreamland. You've never worked to achieve it.
I need love to survive, but you've only ever cared about fictional characters until now... That's like the equivalent of junk food for me. It's not healthy...
According to my calculations... There's exactly one person on the face of the Earth who meets all your unrealistic standards. It's just a shame he's already taken. The chances of you meeting someone else like him are nonexistant.
Hi there, Tangerine! I'm your Life driver. When you're ready to wake up, I'll take you back to reality.
"Here lies Tangerine's Innocence. Cause of death: Browsing the Internet."
"There used to be something here, but you forgot what it was. Now, it's as if it never existed."
